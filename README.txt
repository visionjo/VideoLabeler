OVERVIEW: 

    Tool provides an easy-to-use interface that facilitates labeling of
    actions in videos. 

    Action_Viewer allows the labeler to scroll through video to mark the 
    start and end frame of each action. 

    Unmarked frames are considered to not contain an action (i.e., in 
    between actions).
